    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat a wok over high heat and add 2 tablespoons sesame oil. When the oil shimmers, add the ginger, garlic, scallions and peppers, and cook until fragrant, approximately 2 minutes.</li>
            
        <li>    
            Scrape the aromatics to the sides of the wok, add remaining oil and allow to heat through. Add the chicken, and cook, stirring occasionally, until it is browned and crisping at the edges, approximately 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            
        <li>    
            Add sugar and stir to combine, then add the rice wine and soy sauce, and bring just to a boil. Lower the heat, then simmer until the sauce has reduced and started to thicken, approximately 15 minutes. </li>
            
        <li> 
            Turn off the heat, add the basil and stir to combine. Serve with white rice.</li>
